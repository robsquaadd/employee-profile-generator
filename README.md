# Employee Profile Generator

## Description

This application automatically generates an HTML page that contains information about the employees at a company.

To run the application the user will run node index.js in the command line. The application will then ask for the manager's name, employee id, email, and office number. Once the manager's information is entered, then a menu will allow the user to select if they would like to add another employee and if they would like to add an engineer or an intern.

If the engineer is selected, then the program will ask you for the engineer's name, employee id, email, and github.

If the intern is selected, then the program will ask you for the intern's name, employee id, email, and school.

Once the employee's information is entered, then the program will take you back to the menu.

When you choose the option Generate My HTML, the program will automatically generate the HTML file containing all of the user input for the employees.

An improvement that can be made is that the IDs and emails could be validated to ensure that users put those fields in the proper format.
